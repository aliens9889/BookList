### Booklist
A following tutorial from Stephen Grider to understand React with Redux.

The difference between the original tutorial and this project is that I'm using **yarn** instead of **npm**

So to start the project you have to first install all the dependencies
`yarn install`

Then to run the project you have to type
`yarn start`

This project is for understand better how redux works, the project will show up a list of books and you can click one of that list to observe the book details.
